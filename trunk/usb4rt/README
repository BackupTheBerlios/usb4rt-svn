                                    ------

            Real-Time Universial Serial Bus Stack for Linux/RTAI


Features
    - USB stack core with bulk and control message support
    - UHCI host controller driver (i.e. USB 1.1)
    - Demonstration kernel-mode program that exchanges some packets with
      arbitrary USB devices ("USB-ping")


Requirements
    - UHCI-compatible host controller
    - Linux Kernel 2.6
    - RTAI/fusion 0.8.0 or later


Compilation
    1. "cd .../usb4rt".
    2. "./configure" if fusion has been installed to /usr/realtime/fusion, or
       "./configure --with-rtai=<path_to_fusion_installation>"
    3. "make"
    4. "make install"

Test
    1. Unload standard Linux usb drivers (uhci-hcd / ehci-hcd).
       "rmmod ehci-hcd uhci-hcd "
    2. Plug-in any peripheral USB device you want to contact
       (note: hot-plugging is not supported)
    3. Loading Realtime-Core-Module
       "insmod <usb4rt_install_directory>/modules/rt_usbcore.ko".
    4. Loading Realtime-Universal-Host-Controller-Driver
       "insmod <usb4rt_install_directory>/modules/rt_uhci_hcd.ko".
       Optionally, you can instruct the host-controller driver to attach 
       only to a specific device by issuing
       (1) "insmod <usb4rt_install_directory>/modules/rt_uhci_hcd.ko deviceid=<hex_pci_device-id>".
       (2) "insmod <usb4rt_install_directory>/modules/rt_uhci_hcd.ko irq=<irq-number>".
       (3) "insmod <usb4rt_install_directory>/modules/rt_uhci_hcd.ko ioport=<hex_hcd_io_port>".
    5. Ping an attached USB-device
       "insmod <usb4rt_install_directory>/modules/rt_usb_ping vendor=<device_hex_vendor-id> \
                                                              product=<device_hex_product-id>".
       You should see some report of the required time to exchange packets
       with the addressed peripheral device.
