                                    RT-USB
                                    ------

            Real-Time Universial Serial Bus Stack for Linux/RTAI


Features
    - USB stack core with bulk and control message support
    - UHCI host controller driver (i.e. USB 1.1)
    - Demonstration kernel-mode program that exchanges some packets with
      arbitrary USB devices ("USB-ping")


Requirements
    - UHCI-compatible host controller
    - Linux Kernel 2.6
    - RTAI/fusion 0.7.2 or later


Compilation
    1. "cd .../rtusb".
    2. "make RTAIDIR=<path_to_fusion_installation>", or just "make" if fusion
       has been installed to /usr/realtime/fusion.


Test
    1. Unload standard Linux usb drivers (uhci-hcd / ehci-hcd).
    2. Plug-in any peripheral USB device you want to contact
       (note: hot-plugging is not supported)
    3. "insmod core/rt_usbcore.ko".
    4. "insmod host/rt_uhci_hcd.ko".
       Optionally, you can instruct the host driver to attach only to a
       specific device by issuing
       "insmod host/rt_uhci_hcd.ko device=<hex_pci_device-id>".
    5. "insmod prog/rt_usb_ping vendor=<device_hex_vendor-id> \
                                product=<device_hex_product-id>".
       You should see some report of the required time to exchange packets
       with the addressed peripheral device.
